# Testing Front-End
# Getting Started with Create React App
For Front-End i've used the yarn package manager for stable dependencies and version locking
 -- To install Yarn globally, 
 = State npm install yarn --global 
 = Although, the project can run using npm start, as i've locked the dependencies package.json file it may cause warnings.

### To start the project 
### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!



## To test server 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000/api/products]

### `npm run build`
